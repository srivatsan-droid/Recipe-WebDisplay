Project Overview
This project is a part of the "Getting Started on Frontend Mentor" learning path, where I built a web page that meets the design requirements provided by Frontend Mentor.

Design Requirements
The design requirements included creating a web page with a specific layout, typography, and styling. The page had to include a navigation menu, a hero section, and a nutrition section with specific details.

Challenges Faced
One of the challenges I faced was removing the space between the text and the number in the nutrition section. I overcame this by using CSS to add a margin or padding to the span element containing the number.

Another challenge was adding space between the text and the number as per the design requirements. I achieved this by using CSS to add a margin or padding to the span element containing the number, or by using the &nbsp; entity to add a non-breaking space between the text and the number.

Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
Conclusion
This project was a great opportunity to practice my HTML and CSS skills, and to learn how to overcome specific design challenges. I hope you enjoy exploring this project!
